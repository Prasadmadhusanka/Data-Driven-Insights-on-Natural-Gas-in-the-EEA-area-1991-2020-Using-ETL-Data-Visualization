# Data-Driven-Insights-on-Natural-Gas-in-the-EEA-area-1991-2020-Using-ETL-Data-Visualization
This repository consists of an end-to-end ETL pipeline and interactive data visualizations for analyzing natural gas trends in the EEA from 1991 to 2020. It includes data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) and visualizations with Python.

- **assets:** includes images and GIF files that are used throughout the Jupyter notebook for visualizations, plots, and multimedia representations.
- **data:** stores the various data files, such as raw and processed shapefiles, and the merged data frames and GeoDataFrames.
  Specifically, the **merged_dataframe** folder contains the dataset merged using Pandas, while the **merged_gdf** folder holds the merged GeoDataFrame used for spatial analysis. The **ne_10m_admin_0_countries** and **ne_10m_admin_0_countries_processed** folders include the shapefiles for administrative boundaries at the 10m scale, with the latter containing the processed versions of these files, manipulated using FME (Feature Manipulation Engine).
- **notebooks:** Contains the .ipynb files for the analysis.
- **visualizations:** contains all the visual outputs generated by the analysis, saved as image files. Each tool used to create these visualizations has its own subfolder, ensuring organized storage of images from different tools.
- **README.md:** provides an overview of the project, its objectives, and instructions for usage.
